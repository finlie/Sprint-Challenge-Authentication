1.  Describe Middleware, Sessions (as we know them in express), bcrypt and JWT.
    Middleware consists of function(s) that make changes to the request and response objects.
    Sessions are ways to persist data across requests. Session data can be stored in memory, cookies, memory cache, or a database.
    bcrypt is a password hashing function.
    JSON Web Tokens are data stored client-side upon authentication, e.g. when a user signs in. The server references this data each time the user requests access to protected resources. Time interval of authentication status upon sign-in is configurable, i.e. limited time signed in.

2.  What does bcrypt do in order to prevent attacks?
    With bcrypt, the user has the ability to alter the number of rounds that bcrypt goes through to hash data. Specifically, brcrypt goes through 2^rounds iterations of hashing, with 'rounds' being a number the user specifies.

3.  What are the three parts of the JSON Web Token?
    Header, Payload & Signature.
